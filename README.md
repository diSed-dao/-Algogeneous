# Algogeneous
Representing a technical convergence of Stateless and Stateful Smart Contracts, Algogeneous Smart Contracts include an innovative integration with artificial intelligence. Where previous ASCs must be stateful or stateless, Algogeneous contracts may be stateful, stateless, or both. ASCs can store data on the blockchain, which means that the data is secure and tamper-proof. This makes ASCs a good choice for storing sensitive data, such as user search history.

In addition, ASCs can be used to analyze user search data to identify trends and patterns. This information can be used to improve the search experience for users. For example, ASCs can be used to personalize search results or to suggest relevant products or services.

Overall, ASCs are a versatile tool that can be used to improve the search experience for users in a variety of ways.

Here are some of the benefits of using ASCs to store user search data:

- Security: ASCs can store data on the blockchain, which means that the data is secure and tamper-proof.
- Data analysis: ASCs can be used to analyze user search data to identify trends and patterns.
- Personalization: ASCs can be used to personalize search results or to suggest relevant products or services.
